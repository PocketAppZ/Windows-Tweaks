If you are currently using a browser:
Firefox 
Google Chrome
then turn it off so you don't lose data once the cleanup is finished you can turn it back on.
------------------------------------------
If you use Edge - do not use cleaner because it removes files for the proper functioning of the edge.
If you use OneDrive - do not use cleaner because it removes files for the proper functioning of onedrive.
If you use System Restore - do not use cleaner because it deletes system restore files.

AND MOST IMPORTANT YOU DO IT ON YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY!!!
